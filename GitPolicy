== Git Policy

    * master is reserved for the latest stable code in the project.
      It shouldn't ever contain code that is experimental or that
      hasn't been thoroughly tested. 

    * bug-fixes is a branch which inherits from master. 
      This branch serves as a branch that fixes issues in the latest 
      stable release of the project. 

      Changes made in this branch should be merged into experimental, 
      and tested thoroughly. 
      Ideally, every bug has a test that confirms it has been fixed). 

    * topic-branches(ie, feature branches) inherit from master, and are 
      then merged into experimental to be thoroughly tested.

    * After experimental has been confirmed to be stable, it is merged into
      master.

      The experimental branch is the only branch that gets merged back into 
      master, all other branches(topic branches, bug fixes) are merged into 
      the experimental branch for testing, before being merged into master.

This workflow hasn't been set in stone yet, it might be altered and it's open 
to discussion and possibly change, too.
