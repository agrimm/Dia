== Coding Style

    * Soft tabs(or "spaces") with a width of two spaces should be used when
      identing code.

    * The width of a line of code shouldn't be more than 100 columns, but exceptions
      can be made in certain circumstances such as documentation that exceeds 100 columns
      by a single column or two.

    * When a method receives arguments, parenthesis should always be used. 

The usual Ruby conventions should be applied as well, such as snake_case for method names, 
CamelCase for classes/modules, and UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE for constants which do not reference
a class or module.
