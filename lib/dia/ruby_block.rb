    # This method will tell you if Dia will try to rescue an exception 
    # that could be raised inside your sandbox by returning true or false.

    # By default, dia will not try to rescue the exception for you.  
    # See the setter, {#rescue_exception=} for enabling this feature, and
    # see {#exception} for accessing the exception.
    #
    # Enabling this feature is useful if you need access to an exception
    # raised in your sandbox from the parent process.
    #
    # @return [Boolean] Returns true or false.

    # @param  [Boolean] Boolean A boolean is recommended  but a 
    #                           true(ish) or false(ish) value is suffice.

    # @return [Boolean] Returns the argument passed.

    # This method can be used if you need access(from the parent process)
    # to an exception raised in your sandbox.
    #
    # The method returns the last exception raised after a call to {#run} 
    # or {#run_nonblock}. It returns nil if there is no exception availableâ€¦
    #
    # Every call to {#run} or {#run_nonblock} resets the variable storing 
    # the exception object to nil, and it will only be a non-nil value 
    # if the last call to {#run} or {#run_nonblock} raised an exception.
    #
    # If the sandbox raises an exception rather quickly, and you're using
    # {#run_nonblock} you might need to sleep(X) (0.1-0.3s on my machine) 
    # before the parent process recieves the exception.
    # 
    # @return [Exception, nil]  Returns an instance or subclass instance of 
    #                           Exception when successful, and nil when 
    #                           there is no exception available.
    #
    # @see #rescue_exception=   This feature is disabled by default.
