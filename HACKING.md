## Coding style
* Abide by the "80 Column Rule" when it is practical.
* methods should be identified by parenthesis all the time - foo(), bar(1,2,3).

## Git policy
* "master" should always be in a _working state_.
* Pre releases should never be merged into "master", but should live in
  experimental instead.
* The experimental branch is the _one and only_ gateway to being merged into
  master .. and topic branches should branch off from "experimental".
